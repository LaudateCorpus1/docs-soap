## Contributing to docs-soap
Contributions are welcome, but **please do not commit straight to master** Instead, create a new branch, clone it, make your changes
there, and submit a PR. I will merge PRs and publish versions as needed.

Please make sure each PR has accompanying tests to verify functionality. Tests are found in the `test/` directory, are build on top of
Mocha, and can be run using `npm run test`. Feel free to create new spec files to test functionality instead of just building off of
the existing spec files, `npm run test` will run the whole directory. All tests must pass before I will merge in a pull request.

Happy cleaning :)
